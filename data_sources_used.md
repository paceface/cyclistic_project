# Data Sources Used
- Cyclistic ride data was provided by Cyclistic on a public [file share](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). I downloaded 12 csv files, one for each of the previous 12 months (Nov 2020 â€“ Oct 2021).
- Weather data for the same period was copied from the [NOAA website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00094846/detail) into a csv file.
- I also compared location data to a [zip code map](https://printable-map.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/zip-code-map-chicago-chicago-area-zip-code-map-united-states-of-within-chicago-zip-code-map-printable.jpg)
